						I spearheaded the development of a multi-agent framework for various tasks, our test

						human correction leading up to a total 7.8 ~ 8 seconds.
						previously same document was annotated by annotators, personal recorded time for annotating the
						same document is 94 seconds. This annotation tool offers over 11x speed up for annotators.

							Developed a tool for object concurrency in construction
							process, with real data as a point cloud data and planned data
							from BIM4D file as an object, we used python OCC library for
							checking point cloud density inside BIM4d Objects to classify
							BIM4d objects as existing or non existing in point cloud data.
							the prototype had a 100% accuracy.

							Part of Data extraction in tables depend upon where the

							becomes increasingly important, I developed an annotation tool

                    <span class="project_description">
							A tool for detecting highlighted codes in source PDF document
							and transferring highlights to a targer PDF document, I used
							open
							source libraries PDFMiner and PyPDF2 to recursively traverse
							PDF Objects
							to find highlights inside the Source pdf documents and then
							transfer them
							in similar methodology to Target pdf documents.
							The tool was developed for Vactor Manafacturing Inc, prior to
							the
							tool the company spent 15 minutes per document processing with
							manual labor, the tool spent an average 21 seconds per
							document
							processing getting it closer to maximizing processing
							potential.
